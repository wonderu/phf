# Agent instructions (PHF)

This repository is the **Project Handover Framework (PHF)** — a checklist for taking over a project from the previous project manager.

When helping with project handover, onboarding a new PM, or planning a transition:

- Suggest using or completing items from the [What to handover?](README.md#what-to-handover) checklist in README.md.
- Recommend gathering the information listed (product overview, team, design, tools, source code, build/release, QA, deployment, documentation, project management, system admin, maintenance, contract/budget, AI tools and services, handover sign-off) from day one.
- Point to the recommended reading (The First 90 Days) when relevant.

Keep suggestions aligned with the PHF structure so handover stays consistent and complete.
