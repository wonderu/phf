# Contributing

Contributions to the Project Handover Framework checklist are welcome.

## How to contribute

- **Suggest a new checklist item**: Open an [issue](https://github.com/igorpodsekin/phf/issues) describing the item and where it fits (e.g. under Team, Design, QA).
- **Fix a typo or wording**: Open a pull request with the change.
- **Improve structure or docs**: Open a pull request or issue to discuss.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo (or use a branch if you have write access).
2. Make your changes in the README or other markdown files.
3. Open a pull request with a short description of the change.
4. Ensure the README still renders correctly and numbering/links are consistent.
